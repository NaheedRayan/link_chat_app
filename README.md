# link_chat_app

A new Flutter project to create a group based chat app with end to end encryption. This is a RSA encryption based chat app.
With this app you can communicate with anyone safely..Your private key can be removed from this app anytime if you feel threatened to make all your chats un readable..
Because of RSA generated key the massages in a group is encrypted and nobody can access that info from outside or in the database.

# Why are we calling this a Group based Chat app?

In this chat app we have gone with an approach that is based on groups. To start communicating with anyone in this chat app. Users have to first sign up in this app with their mobile number and then they can start the process.
They have to create a group first then add members to it. They have to use their phone number to add friends.
This group method is used for all one to one chat or one to many chatsâ€¦
We have used firebase as our database and authentication.

# How many users can be in the same group?

There can be  7 users max in a group. Cause  the encrypted message limitations. If a user send message in 7 users group then the message will be 27 times in the database.
